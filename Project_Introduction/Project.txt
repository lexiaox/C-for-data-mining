Compare: Group1 VS Group2
Group1: age < 30
Group2: age in [30, 50]
Group3: age > 50

Steps:

Step 1. Extract data with respect to groups, then log2(n+1) to shrink data
Step 2. Compare(Group1, Group2, Group3) with t-test for differentially epxressed genes 
Step 3. Sort with p-values of t-test ascendently for top 50 genes, grouply
Step 4. Compare the three sets for intersections e.g. IFNG
Step 5. PPT for your pains and gains

1. Read the data from file "GSE205962_gset.txt" into 2-dimentional array (matrix)
2. Twenty-one columns e.g., ID, Blood_Stasis (3), Qi_Blood_Deficiency (4), Liver_Kidney_Deficiency (3), Wind_Dampness_Obstruction (3), Cold_Dampness_Obstruction (3), and Healthy_Control (4).
3. For each of the six groups: one-vs-all others,
     [1] up-regulated genes (min_value_of_group > max_value_all_others)
     [2] down-regulated genes (max_value_of_group < min_value_all_others)
4. Mapping ID to Gene_Symbols with file "GSE205962_ID_mapping.txt"
5. Count the number of up- and down- regulated genes for each of the six groups (12 files e.g., up_A, down_A, ...)
6. Count the frequencies of up- and down- regulated genes (2 files e.g. totalo_up, total_down)
7. Sort descendant on the frequencies of up- and down- regulated genes and write to file "Frequencies.txt" with columns of ID, Gene_Symbol, and Frequency.
8. Write your PPT with "Pains & Gains".
